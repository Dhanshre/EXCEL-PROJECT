Dashboard on the salary of Data Science employees
Given the data of all the employees in the field of Data Science
We read the data and create a Dashboard containing 4 Charts and then add a slicer to that.
The first chart tells us about the proportion of different sies of the company and we can analyse that there are more number of large>medium>small.
In second chart we compare average salary with respect to job title and we conclude that ML Engineer has the highest salary and Applied Scientist has the lowest.
The third chart gives us the insight of count of employment time versus the experience level and we can see that all the senior level employees work full time and entry level employees work Part-time.
The fourth chart is about the average salary of employees with respect to their experience.
Lastly we add the slicer where we can filter the location of the company.
